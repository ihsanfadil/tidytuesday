## Preface

The `palmerpenguins` package is aimed at providing an alternative to the
well-known `iris` dataset, which is commonly used for an introduction to
data exploration and visualisation. A more detailed documentation of the
package can be found
[here](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).

I wanted to familiarise myself with this dataset as well for future use
in lectures on data visualisation with R. And much more importantly,
penguins are so adorable\! 🐧

Now, let’s get started.
