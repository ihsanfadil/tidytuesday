## Preface

The `palmerpenguins` package is aimed at providing an alternative to the well-known `iris` dataset, which is commonly used for an introduction to data exploration and visualisation. A more detailed documentation of the package can be found [here](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).

I wanted to familiarise myself with this dataset as well for future use in lectures on data visualisation with R. And much more importantly, penguins are so adorable! &#x1f427;

Now, let's get started.
