## Preface

The `palmerpenguins` package is aimed at providing an alternative to the well-known `iris` dataset, which is commonly used for an introduction to data exploration and visualisation. A more detailed documentation of the package, developed by Horst and colleagues, can be found [here](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).

I wanted to familiarise myself with the dataset as well for future teaching on data analysis and visualisation with R. Much more importantly, these penguins are so adorable! &#x1f427;

```{r getting-started}
# Setup
library(palmerpenguins) # Data source
library(ggbeeswarm)     # Beeswarm plots
library(tidyverse)      # Data wrangling, visualisation
library(ggExtra)        # Marginal plots
```

## Data

The authors provide two datasets. I am using the simplified version of the raw data, `penguins`.

```{r dataset}
# Dataset
penguins <- penguins %>%               # Read in the data
  na.omit() %>%                        # Complete-case analysis
  mutate(species = as_factor(species), # Modify variables
         island = as_factor(island),
         sex = as_factor(sex),
         year = as_factor(year),
         sex = fct_recode(sex, "Male" = "male", "Female" = "female"))
```

## Visualisation

Firstly, I am going to reproduce the first plot illustrated on the `palmerpenguins` site, with slight modification. This is basically a scatter plot overlaid by ordinary-least-squares regression lines across species. Penguins with longer flippers tended to have a longer bill, irrespective of the species.

```{r plot-setup}
# Set plots to some formatting

## Colours and theme of my choosing
colours_penguins <- c("Gentoo" = "#50A3A4",
                      "Chinstrap" = "#F95335",
                      "Adelie" = "#FCAF38")
theme_set(theme_minimal())

## Further refinement
theme_update(
  plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),    # Centre-align title
  plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5), # Centre-align subtitle
  legend.title = element_blank(),            # Remove legend title
  legend.position = c(0.15, 0.82),           # Move legend to bottom right
  legend.background = element_blank(),       # Remove legend background
  legend.box.background = element_blank(),   # Remove lengend-box background
  legend.spacing.y = unit(0.01, 'mm'),       # Make legend closer
  legend.key.height = unit(0.5, "cm"),       # Make legend closer
  panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),        # Remove minor lines
  axis.title.x = element_text(hjust = 1),    # Move title for x-axis
  axis.title.y = element_text(hjust = 1)     # Move title for y-axis
)
```

```{r scatter-plot}
# Scatter plot
scatter_plot <- penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) +
    geom_jitter(aes(colour = species),
                alpha = 0.20, size = 2.5) +
    geom_smooth(aes(colour = species),
                method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE) +
    scale_colour_manual(values = colours_penguins) +
    coord_fixed(ratio = 1.4) +
    labs(x = "\nFlipper length (mm)\n",
         y = "Bill length (mm)\n",
         title = "\nFlipper and bill length",
         subtitle = "for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins\n")

# Add density plots corresponding to each axis
ggMarginal(scatter_plot, type = "density", margins = "both",
           size = 8, groupFill = TRUE, colour = "transparent", alpha = 0.25)
```

The second plot depicts the distributions of flipper length by sex and species using a beeswarm plot. Relatively few data points in each category due to stratification allow to make use of this pretty-looking plot, which also shows individual observations. On average, male penguins had longer flippers than females did. Also, Gentoo penguins had the longest flippers than the other two species.

```{r beeswarm-plot}
# Beeswarm plot
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = sex, y = flipper_length_mm)) +
    geom_beeswarm(aes(colour = species),
                  size = 1.8, dodge.width = 0.7, alpha = 0.3) +
    scale_colour_manual(values = colours_penguins) +
    coord_fixed(ratio = 0.03) +
    theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()) +
    labs(x = "Sex\n",
         y = "Flipper length (mm)\n",
         title = "\nFlipper length by sex and species",
         subtitle = "for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins\n")
```
